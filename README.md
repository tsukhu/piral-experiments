# Piral Experiments

- This project is to explore all the features of the amazing framework `piral` for building microfrontends
- This is still work in progress

# Current projects

- Piral Instance / App Shell (my-app)
- Piral Pilet #1 / React based pilet (my-pilet) -> Uses JSONHolder API for reading a list of posts
- Piral Pilet #2 / Svelte based pilet (my-svelte) -> CRUD APIs using Firebase
- Piral Pilet #3 / LitElement based pilet (my-litelem-pilet) -> Web Component (current disabled due to Edge browser issues)
- Piral API Extension / NavLink API extension (piral-navlink) -> Piral API extension to provide menu item and tile components built using React Components (NavLink) accessible to non React pilets. (Used in the Svelte App)

# Objectives

- Use Tailwind CSS as the UI framework so that we can have a consistent UI across frameworks
- Try out all features of Piral
- Create cross fx samples - React, LitElements, Svelte, Vue
- Extend the API for customizing
