# Piral Experiments

- This project is to explore all the features of the amazing framework `piral` for building microfrontends

# Current projects

- Piral Instance / App Shell (my-app)
- Piral Pilet #1 / React based pilet (my-pilet)

- The (sample-piral) project is just for reference taken from the [main piral repo](https://github.com/smapiot/piral/tree/master/src/samples/sample-piral). This is only for refering to the best practices, please use the original version from the main piral repo. This will be removed later on once I get the hang of things.

# Objectives

- Use Tailwind CSS as the UI framework
- Try out all features of Piral
- Create cross fx samples - React, LitElements, Svelte, Vue
- Extend the API for customizing
